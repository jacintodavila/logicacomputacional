Core RBAC keeps several sets including the following:
USERS: set of users
ROLES: set of roles
PERMS: set of permissions
UR: set of user-role pairs
PR: set of permission-role pairs
with constraints:
UR is subset of USERS * ROLES
PR is subset of PERMS * ROLES
update functions for each set, subject to the constraints above:
AddUser, DeleteUser, AddRole, DeleteRole, AddPerm, DeletePerm
AddUR, DeleteUR, AddPR, DeletePR, where
each Add has pre-conditions: the element is not in and no constraints
will be violated, and
each Delete has the pre-condition that the element is in, and maintains
the constraints by
updates if needed
and query functions including the following:
AssignedRoles(user): the set of roles assigned to user in UR
UserPermissions(user): the set of permissions assigned to the roles
assigned to user
CheckAccess(user, perm): whether some role is assigned to user and is
granted perm
